# TeaSteepTimer
A simple countdown timer that can be set to 1 or 2 minutes, and flashes red and blue once the timer is done

Instructions:
Keep the batch and the python script in the same folder(or change the batch file to run the python script from its correct location). Run the batch script instead of the python file from Python's shell, due to Tkinter being used, which does not seem to run from Python's shell. 
Feel free to suggest any updates!
